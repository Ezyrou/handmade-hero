# Handmade Hero in Zig

I'm mostly interested in implementing the Windows platform layer for now.

My goal is to learn and keep a record of every step taken so that I can easily reference them.

For this reason, I plan to make heavy use of comments on the episode I'm working on, but do a cleanup commit between each episode to limit the clutter.

So if you want to see my notes for a given episode, switch to the corresponding commit to see the comments.
